# Dysfunctional Family
<small>**[Afdzal Yunus](https://afdzal.dev)** • Sep 15, 2023 (**Last updated:** Sep 15, 2023)</small>

## Introduction
A **dysfunctional family** is a family in which conflict, misbehavior, and often [child neglect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_neglect) or [abuse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_abuse) or all of the above on the part of individual parents occur continuously and regularly. Children that grow up in such families may think such a situation is [normal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_norm). Dysfunctional families are primarily a result of two adults, one typically overtly abusive and the other [codependent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codependency), and may also be affected by substance abuse or other forms of addiction, or sometimes by an untreated [mental illness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_illness). Parents having grown up in a dysfunctional family may over-correct or emulate their own parents. In some cases, the dominant parent will abuse or neglect their children and the other parent will not object, misleading a child to assume blame.

## Children

Unlike divorce, and to a lesser extent, separation, there is often no record of an "intact" family being dysfunctional. As a result, friends, relatives, and teachers of such children may be completely unaware of the situation. In addition, a child may be unfairly blamed for the family's dysfunction, and placed under even greater stress than those whose parents separate.

### The six basic roles
Children growing up in a dysfunctional family have been known to adopt or be assigned one or more of the following six basic roles:
- The **Golden Child** (also known as the **Hero** or **Superkid**): a child who becomes a high achiever or overachiever outside the family (e.g., in academics or athletics) as a means of escaping the dysfunctional family environment, defining themselves independently of their role in the dysfunctional family, currying favor with parents, or shielding themselves from criticism by family members.
- The **Problem Child**, **Rebel**, or **Truth Teller**: the child who a) causes most problems related to the family's dysfunction or b) "[acts out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acting_out)" in response to preexisting family dysfunction, in the latter case often in an attempt to divert attention paid to another member who exhibits a pattern of similar misbehavior.
    - A variant of the "problem child" role is the **[Scapegoat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scapegoat)**, who is unjustifiably assigned the "problem child" role by others within the family or even wrongfully blamed by other family members for those members' own individual or collective dysfunction, often despite being the only emotionally stable member of the family.
- The **Caretaker**: the one who takes responsibility for the emotional well-being of the family, often assuming a parental role; the intra-familial counterpart of the "Good Child"/"Superkid."
- The **Lost Child** or **Passive Kid**: the inconspicuous, [introverted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraversion_and_introversion), quiet one, whose needs are usually ignored or hidden.
- The **Mascot** or **Family Clown**: uses comedy to divert attention away from the increasingly dysfunctional family system.
- The **Mastermind**: the [opportunist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunist) who capitalizes on the other family members' faults to get whatever they want; often the object of appeasement by grown-ups.
