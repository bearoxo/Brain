# Mental disorder
<small>**[Afdzal Yunus](https://afdzal.dev)** • Sep 15, 2023 (**Last updated:** Sep 15, 2023)</small>

## Introduction
A **mental disorder**, also referred to as a **mental illness** or **psychiatric disorder**, is a behavioral or mental pattern that causes significant distress or impairment of personal functioning. A mental disorder is also characterized by a clinically significant disturbance in an individual's cognition, emotional regulation, or behavior. It is usually associated with distress or impairment in important areas of functioning. There are many different types of mental disorders. Mental disorders may also be referred to as mental health conditions. Such features may be persistent, relapsing and remitting, or occur as single episodes. Many disorders have been described, with signs and symptoms that vary widely between specific disorders. Such disorders may be diagnosed by a mental health professional, usually a clinical psychologist or psychiatrist.

The [causes of mental disorders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causes_of_mental_disorders) are often unclear. Theories may incorporate findings from a range of fields. Mental disorders are usually defined by a combination of how a person behaves, feels, perceives, or thinks. This may be associated with particular regions or functions of the brain, often in a social context. A mental disorder is one aspect of mental health. Cultural and religious beliefs, as well as social norms, should be taken into account when making a diagnosis.

Services are based in psychiatric hospitals or in the community, and assessments are carried out by mental health professionals such as psychiatrists, psychologists, psychiatric nurses, and clinical social workers, using various methods such as [psychometric tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychometric_tests) but often relying on observation and questioning. Treatments are provided by various mental health professionals. [Psychotherapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychotherapy) and [psychiatric medication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatric_medication) are two major treatment options. Other treatments include lifestyle changes, social interventions, peer support, and self-help. In a minority of cases, there might be involuntary detention or treatment. Prevention programs have been shown to reduce depression.

In 2019, common mental disorders around the globe include [depression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder), which affects about 264 million people; [bipolar disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder), which affects about 45 million; [dementia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dementia), which affects about 50 million; and [schizophrenia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizophrenia) and other psychoses, which affect about 20 million people. [Neurodevelopmental disorders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurodevelopmental_disorders) include, e.g. [attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder), [autism spectrum disorder (ASD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism_spectrum), and [intellectual disability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_disability), of which onset occurs early in the developmental period. Stigma and [discrimination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mentalism_(discrimination)) can add to the suffering and disability associated with mental disorders, leading to various social movements attempting to increase understanding and challenge [social exclusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_exclusion).

## Disorders
There are many different categories of mental disorder, and many different facets of human behavior and personality that can become disordered.
### Mood disorder
Other affective (emotion/mood) processes can also become disordered. Mood disorder involving unusually intense and sustained sadness, melancholia, or despair is known as [major depression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depression) (also known as unipolar or clinical depression). Milder, but still prolonged depression, can be diagnosed as [dysthymia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysthymia). [Bipolar disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder) (also known as manic depression) involves abnormally "high" or pressured mood states, known as [mania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mania) or [hypomania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypomania), alternating with normal or depressed moods. The extent to which unipolar and bipolar mood phenomena represent distinct categories of disorder, or mix and merge along a dimension or spectrum of mood, is subject to some scientific debate.

### Psychotic disorder
Patterns of belief, language use and perception of reality can become dysregulated (e.g., [delusions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delusions), [thought disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought_disorder), [hallucinations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucinations)). Psychotic disorders in this domain include [schizophrenia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizophrenia), and [delusional disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delusional_disorder). [Schizoaffective disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizoaffective_disorder) is a category used for individuals showing aspects of both schizophrenia and affective disorders. [Schizotypy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizotypy) is a category used for individuals showing some of the characteristics associated with schizophrenia, but without meeting cutoff criteria.

### Personality disorder
[Personality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personality_development)—the fundamental characteristics of a person that influence thoughts and behaviors across situations and time—may be considered disordered if judged to be abnormally rigid and [maladaptive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maladaptive). Although treated separately by some, the commonly used categorical schemes include them as mental disorders, albeit on a separate [axis II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_and_Statistical_Manual_of_Mental_Disorders#Multi_axial_system) in the case of the DSM-IV. A number of different personality disorders are listed, including those sometimes classed as _eccentric_, such as [paranoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranoid_personality_disorder), [schizoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizoid_personality_disorder) and [schizotypal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizotypal_personality_disorder) personality disorders; types that have described as dramatic or emotional, such as [antisocial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisocial_personality_disorder), [borderline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borderline_personality_disorder), [histrionic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histrionic_personality_disorder) or [narcissistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissistic_personality_disorder) personality disorders; and those sometimes classed as fear-related, such as [anxious-avoidant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avoidant_personality_disorder), [dependent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_personality_disorder), or [obsessive–compulsive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsessive%E2%80%93compulsive_personality_disorder) personality disorders. Personality disorders, in general, are defined as emerging in childhood, or at least by adolescence or early adulthood. The ICD also has a category for enduring personality change after a catastrophic experience or psychiatric illness. If an inability to sufficiently adjust to life circumstances begins within three months of a particular event or situation, and ends within six months after the stressor stops or is eliminated, it may instead be classed as an [adjustment disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjustment_disorder). There is an emerging consensus that personality disorders, similar to personality traits in general, incorporate a mixture of acute dysfunctional behaviors that may resolve in short periods, and maladaptive temperamental traits that are more enduring. Furthermore, there are also non-categorical schemes that rate all individuals via a profile of different dimensions of personality without a symptom-based cutoff from normal personality variation, for example through schemes based on dimensional models.

### Eating disorder
An eating disorder is a serious mental health condition that involves an unhealthy relationship with food and body image. They can cause severe physical and psychological problems. Eating disorders involve disproportionate concern in matters of food and weight. Categories of disorder in this area include [anorexia nervosa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anorexia_nervosa), [bulimia nervosa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulimia_nervosa), [exercise bulimia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exercise_bulimia) or [binge eating disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binge_eating_disorder).

### Sleep disorder
Sleep disorders are associated with disruption to normal sleep patterns. A common sleep disorder is [insomnia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insomnia), which is described as difficulty falling and/or staying asleep. Other sleep disorders include [narcolepsy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcolepsy), [sleep apnea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_apnea), [REM sleep behavior disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_eye_movement_sleep_behavior_disorder), [chronic sleep deprivation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_sleep_deprivation), and [restless leg syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restless_legs_syndrome).

Narcolepsy is a condition of extreme tendencies to fall asleep whenever and wherever. People with narcolepsy feel refreshed after their random sleep, but eventually get sleepy again. Narcolepsy diagnosis requires an overnight stay at a sleep center for analysis, during which doctors ask for a detailed sleep history and sleep records. Doctors also use [actigraphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actigraphy) and [polysomnography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polysomnography). Doctors will do a multiple sleep latency test, which measures how long it takes a person to fall asleep.

Sleep apnea, when breathing repeatedly stops and starts during sleep, can be a serious sleep disorder. Three types of sleep apnea include [obstructive sleep apnea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructive_sleep_apnea), [central sleep apnea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_sleep_apnea), and complex sleep apnea. Sleep apnea can be diagnosed at home or with polysomnography at a sleep center. An ear, nose, and throat doctor may further help with the sleeping habits.

### Sexuality related
Sexual disorders include [dyspareunia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyspareunia) and various kinds of [paraphilia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraphilia) (sexual arousal to objects, situations, or individuals that are considered abnormal or harmful to the person or others).

### Other
[Impulse control disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impulse_control_disorder): People who are abnormally unable to resist certain urges or impulses that could be harmful to themselves or others, may be classified as having an impulse control disorder, and disorders such as [kleptomania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleptomania) (stealing) or [pyromania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyromania) (fire-setting). Various behavioral addictions, such as gambling addiction, may be classed as a disorder. Obsessive–compulsive disorder can sometimes involve an inability to resist certain acts but is classed separately as being primarily an anxiety disorder.

[Substance use disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_use_disorder): This disorder refers to the use of drugs (legal or illegal, including [alcohol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholic_beverages)) that persists despite significant problems or harm related to its use. [Substance dependence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence) and [substance abuse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse) fall under this umbrella category in the DSM. Substance use disorder may be due to a pattern of compulsive and repetitive use of a drug that results in tolerance to its effects and withdrawal symptoms when use is reduced or stopped.

[Dissociative disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociative_disorder): People with severe disturbances of their self-identity, memory, and general awareness of themselves and their surroundings may be classified as having these types of disorders, including [depersonalization disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depersonalization_disorder) or [dissociative identity disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociative_identity_disorder) (which was previously referred to as multiple personality disorder or "split personality").

[Cognitive disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_disorder): These affect cognitive abilities, including learning and memory. This category includes [delirium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delirium) and mild and major neurocognitive disorder (previously termed [dementia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dementia)).

[Developmental disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_disorder): These disorders initially occur in childhood. Some examples include [autism spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism_spectrum) disorder, [oppositional defiant disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oppositional_defiant_disorder) and [conduct disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conduct_disorder), and [attention deficit hyperactivity disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder) (ADHD), which may continue into adulthood. Conduct disorder, if continuing into adulthood, may be diagnosed as antisocial personality disorder (dissocial personality disorder in the ICD). Popular labels such as [psychopath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychopath) (or sociopath) do not appear in the DSM or ICD but are linked by some to these diagnoses.

Somatoform disorders may be diagnosed when there are problems that appear to originate in the body that are thought to be manifestations of a mental disorder. This includes [somatization disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatization_disorder) and [conversion disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversion_disorder). There are also disorders of how a person perceives their body, such as [body dysmorphic disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_dysmorphic_disorder). [Neurasthenia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurasthenia) is an old diagnosis involving somatic complaints as well as fatigue and low spirits/depression, which is officially recognized by the ICD-10 but no longer by the DSM-IV.

[Factitious disorders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factitious_disorder) are diagnosed where symptoms are thought to be reported for personal gain. Symptoms are often deliberately produced or feigned, and may relate to either symptoms in the individual or in someone close to them, particularly people they care for.

There are attempts to introduce a category of [relational disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_disorder), where the diagnosis is of a relationship rather than on any one individual in that relationship. The relationship may be between children and their parents, between couples, or others. There already exists, under the category of psychosis, a diagnosis of [shared psychotic disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_psychotic_disorder) where two or more individuals share a particular delusion because of their close relationship with each other.

There are a number of uncommon psychiatric syndromes, which are often named after the person who first described them, such as [Capgras syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capgras_syndrome), [De Clerambault syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Clerambault_syndrome), [Othello syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Othello_syndrome), [Ganser syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganser_syndrome), [Cotard delusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotard_delusion), and [Ekbom syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delusional_parasitosis), and additional disorders such as the [Couvade syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Couvade_syndrome) and [Geschwind syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geschwind_syndrome).
