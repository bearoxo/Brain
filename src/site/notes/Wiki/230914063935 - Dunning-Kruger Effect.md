# Dunning-Kruger Effect
<small>**[Afdzal Yunus](https://afdzal.dev)** • Sep 14, 2023 (**Last updated:** Sep 14, 2023)</small>

## Introduction
The **Dunning–Kruger effect** is a [cognitive bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_bias) in which people with limited competence in a particular domain overestimate their abilities.

The Dunning–Kruger effect is usually measured by comparing self-assessment with objective performance. For example, participants may take a quiz and estimate their performance afterward, which is then compared to their actual results. The initial study was published by David Dunning and Justin Kruger in 1999. It focused on [logical reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_reasoning), grammar, and social skills. Since then other studies have been conducted across a wide range of tasks. They include skills from fields such as business, politics, medicine, driving, aviation, spatial memory, examinations in school, and literacy.

There are disagreements about what causes the Dunning–Kruger effect. According to the [metacognitive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacognition) explanation, poor performers misjudge their abilities because they fail to recognize the qualitative difference between their performances and the performances of others. The statistical model explains the empirical findings as a statistical effect in combination with the general tendency to think that one is better than average. The rational model holds that overly positive prior beliefs about one's skills are the source of false self-assessment. Another explanation claims that self-assessment is more difficult and error-prone for low performers because many of them have very similar skill levels.
